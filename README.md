---
Mobile development enthusiast working with android for over 6 years. I am passionate about all the things that we can do with mobile phones and 
consitently keep implementing new solutions through my side projects. I am also a big fan of architecting code and maintaining code quality because I beleive
a well architected application strengthens the foundations and improves scalability. 
<br/><br/>
Moreover as a developer, I like to keep my code as DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) as possible and eventually I like to have a codebase where everything is a utility function or extension function that can be reused everywhere so I can focus on developing features more. 
<br/><br/>

I also work as an independent contrator in my spare time. You can reach out to me for 
- ðŸ’¼ any project development tasks
- :iphone: any technical consultations for mobile development 
- ðŸ’¬ or even just saying hello! I am an open guy and would love to connect.
